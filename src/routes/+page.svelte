<h2>What is Lirdle--? What even is Lirdle?</h2>
<p>Lirdle-- is a clone of <a href="http://lirdle.com">Lirdle</a>, a Wordle clone except it lies once per line. A few friends and I like to play this game, and I thought "you know what would be pretty funny? this, except it only lies sometimes." a couple hours later, I had this. it wasn't as funny as I'd hoped, but eh. it's too late now. Enjoy!</p>
